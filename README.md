# mpcnc-inkscape-unicorn
MPCNC Inkscape GCode Plugin based on original Unicorn

## What does it do?
This plugin allows one to create GCode for use with the MPCNC running Marlin firmware.
It is able to parse Inkscape vector files using *mm* units where the original Unicorn threw an error when using these units.

I have primarily created this version for use with a needle cutter/pen combo.
